## A little about me

I'm Varsha B Reddy. 23 years old living in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

I completed a three-month intermediate UX design course from imagin XP.
During that time, I found out that I'm passionate about Product design.
I would love seeing my designs come to life and help people in their daily lives.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside the project, you'll see the following folders:

```bash
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ sneak-peek/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
```

All the folders have different purposes and contain files required by the server to make the webpage work.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
